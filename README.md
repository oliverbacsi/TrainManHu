This is my very first Python program just to try this language.
* I always liked **ATC** (Air Traffic Controller) from the **BSDgames** package, I even branched the git package and developped the ANSI color version of it. Later on I even developped a more advanced, graphical version of it in Tcl/Tk language, see **tkATC**. I always wanted to have a similar game but with Trains instead of Planes.
* A good inspiration was the online train map of the Hungarian Railways (http://vonatinfo.mav-start.hu/), but rather than just watch I wanted to coordinate the trains...
* Also there is Transport Tycoon Deluxe from the good old DOS times (nowadays **OpenTTD**) as the non plus ultra of all Train Management games. I've been loving it since the '90s... But it is a long-run strategy game that needs at least an afternoon to play it, if You have just 20 minutes then it's simply not worth to start it. To be honest I always enjoyed the constructing part of the game instead of the financial side and competing.

So I decided to code something inbetween. Something with simplified game logic, easy rules, quickly playable, for casual gamers who have like half an hour to waste with some fun game.

In this game You have some locomotives available to control. You can attach wagons to them and give them orders where to go. Locomotives have limited capacity for wagons and limited speed. Your goal is to bring the wagons to the desired destination station keeping the time deadlines to deliver. One missed deadline reduces Your lives by one. When all 3 lives are gone the game is over. Try to collect as many points as possible by delivering the most wagons in the shortest time.
After reaching certain game points You get additional locomotives which are faster and stronger so that they can pull more wagons with higher speed, but Your transport tasks will also start to pile up: You'll have to transport more wagons to higher distances.
Good luck for managing them all... !
